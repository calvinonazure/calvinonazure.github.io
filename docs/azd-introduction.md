# AZD Introduction

Azure Developer CLI (azd) is an open-source tool that accelerates the time it takes for you to get your application from local development environment to Azure.  
Azd provides best practice, developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow, whether youâ€™re working in the terminal, your editor or integrated development environment (IDE), or CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment).
